# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
    # Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
    # Example input: 39
    # Example output: 3 + 9 = 12
        # output = 12

# Hints:
    # Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.
    # Think about what you learnt about subscripting.
    # Think about type conversion.
