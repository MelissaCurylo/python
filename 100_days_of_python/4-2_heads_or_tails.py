# Heads or Tails

# Instructions: You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".
    # Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.
    # Generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails. 
        # e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails
        # Example Output: Heads   or   Tails


#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#Hint: Remember to import the random module first. ðŸŽ²
