# # Pizza Order App

# Instructions
# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

        # Small Pizza: $15
        # Medium Pizza: $20
        # Large Pizza: $25

        # Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
        # Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
        # Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

# Example Input
    # size = "L"
    # add_pepperoni = "Y"
    # extra_cheese = "N"

# Example Output
    # Your final bill is: $28.

# Hint: 
# Think about what you've learnt about multiple if statements and see if you can reduce the number of lines of code while having the same functionality.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
