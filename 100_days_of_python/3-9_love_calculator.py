# # Love Calculator

# ðŸ’ª This is a Difficult Challenge ðŸ’ª

# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:
    # Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
        # Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
        # Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
    
    # For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
        # "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
    
    # For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
        # "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
    
    # Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
        # "Your score is **z**."

    # e.g.
        # name1 = "Angela Yu"
        # name2 = "Jack Bauer"
            # T occurs 0 times
            # R occurs 1 time
            # U occurs 2 times
            # E occurs 2 times
            # Total = 5

            # L occurs 1 time
            # O occurs 0 times
            # V occurs 0 times
            # E occurs 2 times
            # Total = 3

            # Love Score = 53
            # Print: "Your score is 53."

# Example Input 1
    # name1 = "Brad Pitt"
    # name2 = "Jennifer Aniston"
    # Example Output 2
        # Your score is 73.

# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:
    # "Your score is 47, you are alright together."
    # "Your score is 125, you go together like coke and mentos."
    # "Your score is 54."

# Hint
    # The lower() function changes all the letters in a string to lower case.

    # The count() function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string.
