# Instructions: 
    # If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
    # Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
    # Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
    # Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.
    
    #  Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

# Example Input: Welcome to the tip calculator!
                # What was the total bill? $124.56
                # How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
                # How many people to split the bill? 7
# Example Output: Each person should pay: $19.93
